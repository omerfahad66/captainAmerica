            Captain America is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by
            cartoonists Joe Simon and Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in Captain America Comics #1 (cover dated
            March 1941) from Timely Comics, a predecessor of Marvel Comics. Captain America was designed as a patriotic
            supersoldier who often fought the Axis powers of World War II and was Timely Comics' most popular character
            during the wartime period. The popularity of superheroes waned following the war, and the Captain America
            comic book was discontinued in 1950, with a short-lived revival in 1953. Since Marvel Comics revived the
            character in 1964, Captain America has remained in publication.

            The character wears a costume bearing an American flag motif, and he utilizes a nearly-indestructible shield
            that he throws as a projectile. Captain America is the alter ego of <strong>Steve Rogers</strong>, a frail young artist
            enhanced to the peak of human perfection by an experimental "super-soldier serum" after joining the military
            to aid the United States government's efforts in World War II. Near the end of the war, he was trapped in
            ice and survived in suspended animation until he was revived in modern times. Although Captain America often
            struggles to maintain his ideals as a man out of his time, he remains a highly respected figure in his
            community, which includes becoming the long-time leader of the Avengers.

            Captain America was the first Marvel Comics character to appear in media outside comics with the release of
            the 1944 movie serial, Captain America. Since then, the character has been featured in other films and
            television series. In the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), the character is portrayed by Chris Evans.
            Captain America was ranked sixth on IGN's "Top 100 Comic Book Heroes of All Time" in 2011, second in
            their list of "The Top 50 Avengers" in 2012, and second in their "Top 25 best Marvel superheroes" list in
            2014.
